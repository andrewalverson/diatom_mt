Besides specifying "DNA alignment," I used default commands for all Gblocks runs, 
except I specified "with half" allowed gap positions. On command line, this would look
like:

	gblocks.exe $ALIGNMENT -t d -b5 h

However, Gblocks calculates different default settings depending on your alignment.
If you want to know specifically what the settings were for each alignment, those are
listed below:

group_cox1_g2A_all_filtered.aligned.fa
	-t  d
	-b1 9
	-b2 13
	-b3 8
	-b4 10
	-b5 h

group_cox1_g2B_all_filtered.aligned.fa
	-t  d
	-b1 6
	-b2 9
	-b3 8
	-b4 10
	-b5 h

group_cox1_g2D_all_filtered.aligned.fa
	-t  d
	-b1 4
	-b2 5
	-b3 8
	-b4 10
	-b5 h

group_cox1_g2F_all_filtered.aligned.fa
	-t  d
	-b1 4
	-b2 5
	-b3 8
	-b4 10
	-b5 h

group_rnl_g2A_all_filtered.aligned.fa
	-t  d
	-b1 4
	-b2 5
	-b3 8
	-b4 10
	-b5 h
